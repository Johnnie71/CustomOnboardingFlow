# Monorepo Project: FastAPI & Next.js Onboarding Flow

Welcome to the Onboarding Flow monorepo! This project consists of a FastAPI-based backend and a Next.js frontend, designed to provide a seamless user experience. The backend handles API requests and is connected to a database using SQLAlchemy, while the frontend is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive UI.

You can access the live application here: [Onboarding Flow](https://onboardingflow12.netlify.app) with your browser to see the result.
